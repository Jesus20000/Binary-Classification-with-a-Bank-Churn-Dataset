# Binary Classification with a Bank Churn Dataset

## Introduction

This repository contains a project for binary classification on a Bank Churn dataset. The objective of this project is to predict customer churn using various machine learning models.

## Contents

1. **Data Exploration**: Initial examination of the dataset, including information and descriptive statistics.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analysis of the data to uncover patterns, including null values, categorical and numerical variable analysis, and correlation analysis.
3. **Modeling**: Training and evaluation of multiple classification models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
